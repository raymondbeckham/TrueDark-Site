# The Interval

<span class="entity-badge entity-badge--dark">History — Recurring Threat</span>

**The Interval** is the name given to the span of time between attempted **[Archfiend](../beings/the-archfiend.md)** risings. It is measured from the appearance of the **black cloud** to the next such appearance.

The **black cloud** is understood as the approach-sign of an **Archfiend** event. It does not form over **[Farshadow](../places/farshadow.md)**, but travels along a fixed path toward **[the Crossing](../places/the-crossing.md)**. The cloud dissipates only after an attempted rising fails or is repelled.

## Observed Intervals

One **Interval** was observed during the Wandering, far off and at great distance. The **[Kinsfolk](../beings/kinsfolk.md)** were not close enough to witness the outcome.

The first **Interval** after settlement culminated approximately ten years after the founding of **Farshadow** (c. 10 AF). This **Interval** ended in **[the Night-Sun Event](night-sun-event.md)**.

Subsequent recorded appearances indicate an **Interval** of approximately **forty-seven years**. Two further **Intervals** have occurred since **the Night-Sun Event**. One ended with the arrival of the **black cloud** without a visible **Archfiend** rising — believed to be due to **the Night-Sun** preventing manifestation. The absence of visible consequence created a false negative, leading many to dismiss the cloud as meaningless.

## Cultural Impact

Repeated **Intervals** without clear catastrophe led to the belief that the **black cloud** was symbolic or harmless, and that **the Interval** represented safety rather than delay. This belief contributed directly to the decline of vigilance.

!!! danger "Current Timeline"
    At the time of this record, **Farshadow** stands at the edge of the next projected **Interval**. The current year is approximately **150 AF**. Based on prior records, the next appearance of the **black cloud** is expected within the year or the next. Public confidence remains high, while archival concern quietly increases.
