# The Scorching

<span class="entity-badge entity-badge--light">History — Cataclysm</span>

**The Scorching** was **[Eyru's](../beings/eyru.md)** response to the corruption of **[Lightmere](../places/lightmere.md)**. It was an unleashing of overwhelming **[TrueLight](../systems/truelight.md)** upon the world.

## Effects on the Highborn

**[Highborn](../beings/highborn.md)** who would not reflect **TrueLight** — because of their darkness — were burned away to spirit. Their physical husks were destroyed, leaving only a soul. **[Nova](../beings/nova.md)** and **[the Elect](../beings/the-elect.md)** were burned to spirit in this way, becoming **[Umbra](../beings/umbra.md)** and **[the Shades](../beings/the-shades.md)** respectively.

**Highborn** who still carried some light survived to varying degrees, though they were diminished and fractured by **the Scorching**. These survivors became **[the Keepers](../beings/the-keepers.md)**.

## Effects on the World

The world of **Lightmere** was scarred into **[Deepmere](../places/deepmere.md)** — barren, wounded, but survivable.

!!! danger "Key Distinction"
    **[The Fall](the-fall.md)** refers to the event of **Lightmere's** corruption. **The Scorching** refers specifically to **Eyru's** response — the cataclysmic release of **TrueLight** that burned the corrupted, transformed the survivors, and scarred the world into **Deepmere**.
