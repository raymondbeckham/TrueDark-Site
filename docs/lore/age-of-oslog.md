# The Age of Oslog & Early Farshadow

<span class="entity-badge entity-badge--light">History</span>

## The First Years

Early years at **[Farshadow](../places/farshadow.md)** were marked by active watch and vigilance. Initial shelter consisted of tents and temporary structures, later abandoned in favor of permanent stone and wood buildings. Construction was deliberate and gradual, prioritizing durability.

Wood was not harvested from the ancient forest surrounding the lake inhabited by **[Oslog](../beings/oslog.md)**. That forest was left untouched by axe for many years out of caution and respect. Timber was instead gathered from a more distant forest to the north.

## Night Watches

Night watches were maintained continuously, even as immediate pressure eased. **[The Pursuer](../beings/the-pursuer.md)** (**[Shades](../beings/the-shades.md)**) had ceased direct pressing during this period. Watches focused on preventing **[Dark Beastlings](../systems/darklife.md)** from entering the settlement at evening. Small fires were maintained for light and defense. Firewood was limited due to construction needs.

**Oslog's** activity reinforced belief in lasting safety. Fire and perimeter discipline were strictly observed.
