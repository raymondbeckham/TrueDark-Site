# Nova & the Insurrection

<span class="entity-badge entity-badge--dark">History — Dark</span>

**[Nova](../beings/nova.md)** — an individual, powerful **[Highborn](../beings/highborn.md)** — conducted secret works in darkness. He believed **[Lightmere](../places/lightmere.md)** could be perfected under his guidance. During **[Eyru's](../beings/eyru.md)** absence, he led dissonance and insurrection. He sought to seize authority in the absence of the creator rather than overthrow **Eyru** directly. The act is later remembered as a coup attempted in silence, not open war.

## The Elect

**[The Elect](../beings/the-elect.md)** were **Highborn** who followed **Nova**. They shared in his insurrection during **Eyru's** absence. Entrusted with distinct domains of governance and function within **Lightmere**, they acted as **Nova's** lieutenants and commanders rather than mere followers. Each gave themselves over to the same darkness **Nova** had begun to emit. Their fall was gradual before it was catastrophic.
