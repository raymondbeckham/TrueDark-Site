# Core Definitions

The following terms appear throughout this wiki. Each has its own dedicated page, but brief definitions are provided here so that no term is encountered without context.

---

## Deepmere

The world. Originally called **[Lightmere](../places/lightmere.md)** in its first, radiant state. After the catastrophe known as **[the Fall](../events/the-fall.md)**, the world was scarred and renamed **Deepmere**. The name derives from *mere*, meaning ground or soil. **[Umbra](../beings/umbra.md)** now resides within it.

## Farshadow

The permanent settlement founded by the **[Kinsfolk](../beings/kinsfolk.md)** at a place called **[the Crossing](../places/the-crossing.md)** — the intersection of **[Worldlines](../systems/worldlines.md)** and the furthest possible distance from **[Eyru](../beings/eyru.md)** and **[Calmere](../places/calmere.md)**. Chosen for abundant resources and perceived protection. Darkness does not follow freely into **Farshadow**, but remains present beyond its boundary.

## Worldlines

Invisible lines of force or connection that run through **[Deepmere](../places/deepmere.md)**. Their origin and full nature are not understood. They intersect at a single point — **[the Crossing](../places/the-crossing.md)** — which is the furthest possible distance from **[Eyru](../beings/eyru.md)** and **[Calmere](../places/calmere.md)**. The **[Kinsfolk](../beings/kinsfolk.md)** discovered the **Worldlines** during the Wandering and followed them to **the Crossing**. Darkness appears to respect or avoid the intersection point, though the reason is unknown.

## TrueLight

The highest form of light. Pre-material, objective force. Source of creation for both **[Highborn](../beings/highborn.md)** and **[Kinsfolk](../beings/kinsfolk.md)**. Cannot be destroyed or created artificially. Burns corruption and corrupted beings away.

## TrueDark

The absolute absence of light. Enables **[Umbra's](../beings/umbra.md)** influence and the emergence of **[Umbral Essence](../systems/umbral-essence.md)**. The conditions under which darkness gains power in **[Deepmere](../places/deepmere.md)**.

## Beastlings

The common term for animals. A squirrel is a forest **beastling**; a fish is a water **beastling**. The word carries no negative connotation — it simply means a living creature of the wild. **Beastlings** are named by their habitat: forest beastlings, mountain beastlings, shore beastlings, and so on.

## Dark Beastlings

Dead **beastlings** (animals) or severed, disembodied limbs reanimated by **[Umbral Essence](../systems/umbral-essence.md)**. The reanimation produces **[DarkLife](../systems/darklife.md)** — a zombie-like state in which the remains are bent entirely toward the destruction of things of the light, particularly **[Kinsfolk](../beings/kinsfolk.md)**. Named by combining "Dark" with the creature's habitat type: a reanimated forest squirrel is a **Dark Forest Beastling**; a reanimated shore crab is a **Dark Shore Beastling**.

**Destruction:** A Dark Beastling can be destroyed by physical damage sufficient to render the body unable to act, or by fire — burned to cinder and ash. **[TrueLight](../systems/truelight.md)** burns their skin and husk on contact (much like sunlight on a vampire), but low levels of **TrueLight** will not kill them outright. Only intense or sustained **TrueLight** is lethal.

## The Crossing

The intersection of **[Worldlines](../systems/worldlines.md)** — the furthest point from **[Eyru](../beings/eyru.md)** and **[Calmere](../places/calmere.md)**. Darkness generally seems to hold back from this point. The site where **[Farshadow](../places/farshadow.md)** was founded.

## The Interval

The span of time between attempted **[Archfiend](../beings/the-archfiend.md)** risings, measured from one appearance of the **black cloud** to the next. The observed **Interval** is approximately forty-seven years.
