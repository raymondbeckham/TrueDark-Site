# Creation & Cosmic Origins

<span class="entity-badge entity-badge--light">History</span>

At the beginning, **[Eyru](../beings/eyru.md)** — **[TrueLight](../systems/truelight.md)** incarnate — rested upon **[Calmere](../places/calmere.md)** and created the world of **[Lightmere](../places/lightmere.md)**.

**Eyru** created the **[Highborn](../beings/highborn.md)** — beings who naturally emitted **TrueLight**. They were the original inhabitants, builders of early civilization who felt themselves only slightly beneath **Eyru**.

**Eyru** later sang the **[Kinsfolk](../beings/kinsfolk.md)** into existence as a separate act of creation (see [The Kinsfolk](../beings/kinsfolk.md)). The nature of the song is unknown; whether it contained words is unresolved. **Kinsfolk** were formed where light and sound met.

After creation, **Eyru** departed, leaving **[the Sun](../systems/the-sun.md)** as a continuing presence — **TrueLight** set in the sky, circling **[Deepmere](../places/deepmere.md)** continuously as offered protection for all who inhabit the world.
