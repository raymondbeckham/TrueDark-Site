# The Days of Walked Nights

<span class="entity-badge entity-badge--light">History — Wandering Era</span>

## Departure from Eyru

No command to leave. Departure was driven by curiosity for unlived life — drawn by the different, the unknown, and the dark. Darkness did not seize the **[Kinsfolk](../beings/kinsfolk.md)** at once; it lured them slowly. Each step away felt reasonable. A little darkness was taken in at a time.

It was not understood that returning toward the Light would become difficult and painful once darkness was accepted. Many who attempted to return found the Light blinding and burning as they approached. The ability to perfectly reflect **[Eyru's](../beings/eyru.md)** light was diminished as darkness was taken in. Return was believed possible, but the cost was felt to be too high. Every step taken deeper into the dark increased that cost, making return less likely.

## Key Characteristics of the Wandering

Continuous movement. Fire used as boundary, not comfort. **[The Shades](../beings/the-shades.md)** applied pressure from behind, shepherding the **Kinsfolk** away from **Eyru**.

During this era, the **Kinsfolk** encountered nine **[Keepers](../beings/the-keepers.md)** — diminished **[Highborn](../beings/highborn.md)** who each offered knowledge at a structural cost. At every encounter except **Nareth**, some among the **Kinsfolk** chose to remain behind.
