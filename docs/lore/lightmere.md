# The First World: Lightmere

<span class="entity-badge entity-badge--light">History</span>

**Lightmere** was the original state of the world — suffused with **[TrueLight](../systems/truelight.md)**, radiant, ordered, creative. This was the world before **[the Fall](../events/the-fall.md)**.

The **[Highborn](../beings/highborn.md)** inhabited **Lightmere** as its original builders and stewards. They emitted **TrueLight** innately and felt themselves only slightly beneath **[Eyru](../beings/eyru.md)**.

This era ended when **[Nova](../beings/nova.md)** conducted secret works in darkness, leading to the **[Insurrection](insurrection.md)** and ultimately **[the Fall](../events/the-fall.md)**.
