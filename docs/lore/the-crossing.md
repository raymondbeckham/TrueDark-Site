# The Crossing & Farshadow

<span class="entity-badge entity-badge--place">History</span>

After the long Wandering and encounters with nine **[Keepers](../beings/the-keepers.md)**, the **[Kinsfolk](../beings/kinsfolk.md)** discovered the intersection of **[Worldlines](../systems/worldlines.md)** — the furthest possible distance from **[Eyru](../beings/eyru.md)** and **[Calmere](../places/calmere.md)**.

Darkness generally seemed to hold back from this point — originally believed to be due to **[Oslog](../beings/oslog.md)**. Despite this, the location is highly vulnerable to darkness.

**[Farshadow](../places/farshadow.md)** was founded at **the Crossing**. Chosen for abundant resources and the ability to sustain life. Considered safer due to the perceived protection of **Oslog**, believed to destroy **[Dark Beastlings](../systems/darklife.md)** that approached in the night. Exhaustion played a role in the decision, but the choice was deliberate rather than desperate.

Darkness does not follow freely, but remains present beyond the boundary. Vigilance remains necessary.
