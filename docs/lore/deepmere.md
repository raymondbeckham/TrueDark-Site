# The Broken World: Deepmere

<span class="entity-badge entity-badge--dark">History</span>

The world after **[the Fall](the-fall.md)** and **[the Scorching](the-scorching.md)**. Scarred, wounded, but survivable. **[Umbra](../beings/umbra.md)** resides within it.

Under conditions of **[TrueDark](../systems/truedark.md)**, **[Umbral Essence](../systems/umbral-essence.md)** seeps outward from **Umbra** through the body of **Deepmere**, reanimating dead **[beastlings](../systems/beastlings.md)** and disembodied remains into **[Dark Beastlings](../systems/darklife.md)** — hostile, zombie-like threats to all things of the light.

The **[Archfiend](../beings/the-archfiend.md)** represents **Umbra** himself pressing outward in rare moments of attempted direct manifestation. **[The Shades](../beings/the-shades.md)** — former **[Elect](../beings/the-elect.md)** burned to spirit — walk the surface in shadow.
