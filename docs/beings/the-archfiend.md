# The Archfiend

<span class="entity-badge entity-badge--dark">Being — Dark Manifestation</span>

Name given by unknowing **[Kinsfolk](kinsfolk.md)** to a singular presence brought forth by **[Umbra](umbra.md)**. Used during rare moments when **Umbra** attempts direct manifestation.

Not a **[Shade](the-shades.md)** and not **[Umbral Essence](../systems/umbral-essence.md)**. Represents **Umbra** himself pressing outward, or a partial embodiment thereof. The term reflects fear and misinterpretation rather than accurate understanding.

The **Archfiend** attempts to rise during **[the Interval](../events/the-interval.md)**, heralded by the arrival of the **black cloud** along the **[Worldlines](../systems/worldlines.md)** toward **[the Crossing](../places/the-crossing.md)**.
