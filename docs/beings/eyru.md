# Eyru

<span class="entity-badge entity-badge--light">Being — Creator</span>

Personified creator, understood as a being rather than an abstraction. **[TrueLight](../systems/truelight.md)** incarnate, not merely a source of light. Creator of the **[Highborn](highborn.md)** and later the **[Kinsfolk](kinsfolk.md)**. Does not issue commands; creation is not coercive.

At creation, sang the **Kinsfolk** into existence. The nature of the song is unknown; whether it contained words is unresolved. **Kinsfolk** were formed where light and sound met.

**Eyru** rested upon **[Calmere](../places/calmere.md)** at the beginning of **[Deepmere](../places/deepmere.md)**, then later departed, leaving **[the Sun](../systems/the-sun.md)** as a continuing presence.
