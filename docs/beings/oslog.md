# Oslog

<span class="entity-badge entity-badge--light">Being — Protector</span>

A great ape (gorilla-like) inhabiting the ancient forest surrounding the lake at **[the Crossing](../places/the-crossing.md)**. Possesses white fur that becomes luminous at night. Bathes in waters rich with bioluminescent seaweed, trapping glowing spores in his fur. Emerges primarily at night as a glowing presence.

Observed violently destroying **[Dark Beastlings](../systems/darklife.md)** and darklings. Displays intense hostility toward creatures of darkness. Was already active when the **[Kinsfolk](kinsfolk.md)** first arrived at **the Crossing**. Acknowledged the **Kinsfolk** upon their arrival but did not engage beyond continuing his work.

Inhabits the forest and shoreline; rarely, if ever, seen during daylight hours. Early **Kinsfolk** interpreted his actions as protective, though this intent is unconfirmed. Relationship with the **Kinsfolk** remained distant and non-domestic.
