# Nova

<span class="entity-badge entity-badge--dark">Being — Dark</span>

An individual, powerful **[Highborn](highborn.md)**. Conducted secret works in darkness. Believed **[Lightmere](../places/lightmere.md)** could be perfected under his guidance. Led dissonance and insurrection during **[Eyru's](eyru.md)** absence.

He sought to seize authority in the absence of the creator rather than overthrow **Eyru** directly. The act is later remembered as a coup attempted in silence, not open war.

## What Nova Became

After **[the Scorching](../events/the-scorching.md)**, **Nova** was driven into **[Deepmere](../places/deepmere.md)** by **Eyru's** furious **[TrueLight](../systems/truelight.md)** — pressed beneath the surface rather than cast deliberately. He became **[Umbra](umbra.md)**.
