# Umbra

<span class="entity-badge entity-badge--dark">Being — Primary Antagonist</span>

What **[Nova](nova.md)** became after **[the Fall](../events/the-fall.md)**. Driven into **[Deepmere](../places/deepmere.md)** by **[Eyru's](eyru.md)** furious **[TrueLight](../systems/truelight.md)** during **[the Scorching](../events/the-scorching.md)** — pressed beneath the surface rather than cast deliberately.

His spirit now resides within **Deepmere**. Opposes **Eyru** and all light. Dares to emerge only under conditions of **[TrueDark](../systems/truedark.md)**. Exploits **TrueDark** conditions to extend influence and attempt manifestation.

## Umbral Essence

**[Umbral Essence](../systems/umbral-essence.md)** emits from **Umbra** himself, seeping outward through the body of **Deepmere** under conditions of **TrueDark**. It is an extension of his presence — diffuse and impersonal — that reanimates the dead into **[Dark Beastlings](../systems/darklife.md)**.

## The Archfiend

The **[Archfiend](the-archfiend.md)** represents **Umbra** himself pressing outward during rare moments of attempted direct manifestation.
