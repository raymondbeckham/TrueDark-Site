# The Shades

<span class="entity-badge entity-badge--dark">Being — Survivors of the Fall</span>

What **[the Elect](the-elect.md)** became after **[the Scorching](../events/the-scorching.md)**. Multiple entities who can act in coordination or entirely alone. Not a hive mind; they do not share thoughts or perception. They retain memory, intent, and individual will.

Not controlled directly by **[Umbra](umbra.md)**, but bound to him by fate. They share **Umbra's** doom, though their fate is considered less absolute — they may still walk the surface of **[Deepmere](../places/deepmere.md)** in shadow.

Greatly diminished from their **[Highborn](highborn.md)** state. Harbor deep hatred for **[Eyru](eyru.md)** and for **[Kinsfolk](kinsfolk.md)**. Serve **Umbra's** purpose through choice, alignment, and shared ruin.
