# The Sparkless

<span class="entity-badge entity-badge--dark">Being — Social Outcasts</span>

## Social Position

The **Sparkless** are widely viewed as failed, unreliable, and socially diminished. They are blamed for disorder, decay, and unsanitary conditions. Simultaneously pitied and resented. Considered dirty but necessary.

## Community & Underground

**Sparkless** tend to associate primarily with one another, forming small, informal groups. They share knowledge through word-of-mouth, not record. They occupy marginal spaces: service tunnels, refuse zones, peripheral dwellings. Not openly rebellious, but ideologically opposed to **[Temple](../systems/temple-of-knowledge.md)** doctrine.

## Belief & Practice

The **Sparkless** maintain belief in the reality of **[the Archfiend](the-archfiend.md)**, the existence of **[the Pursuer](the-pursuer.md)**, and the imminence of **[the Interval](../events/the-interval.md)**. They treat old accounts as literal record, not metaphor. They speak of **[Eyru](eyru.md)** as a being, not abstraction.

## Ritual Behavior

They keep small fires at night intentionally, even when discouraged. They perform daytime burn rites with exceptional care. They observe old warnings and signs. They treat darkness as active and willful.

## Relationship to the Temple

The **Sparkless** reject modern **[Temple](../systems/temple-of-knowledge.md)** teachings. They view knowledge as having failed them. They adhere to older practices because the new system offered no place, and old vigilance provided meaning and protection.
