# The Keepers

<span class="entity-badge entity-badge--keeper">Being — Survivors of the Fall</span>

Former **[Highborn](highborn.md)** who retained fragments of light during **[the Scorching](../events/the-scorching.md)**. Diminished, isolated, and conflicted. They share little to no common culture or doctrine. Dangerous as often as helpful.

Each **Keeper** encountered by the **[Kinsfolk](kinsfolk.md)** during the **[Wandering](../lore/walked-nights.md)** offered a real gift paired with a structural cost. In every case except **Nareth**, some among the **Kinsfolk** chose to remain behind with the **Keeper** when the others departed.

## The Nine Keepers Encountered

<div class="keeper-card">

#### Stormech
Healing arts, medicine, binding, knots, weaving, and the treatment of wounds.

#### Nareth (The Never-Met Keeper)
Seen from afar; his true name unknown. Judged too dangerous after many prior bargains.

Shelter, permanence, and comfort. Vast carved caverns with warm beds, furnaces, and lasting stonework. Taught advanced stone cutting, metallurgy, alloying, and high-heat smithing.
