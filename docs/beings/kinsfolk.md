# The Kinsfolk

<span class="entity-badge entity-badge--light">Being — Primary People</span>

The **Kinsfolk** were created by **[Eyru](eyru.md)**, who sang them into existence. They are not survivors of **[the Fall](../events/the-fall.md)** or **[the Scorching](../events/the-scorching.md)** — they were created afterward, as a separate act. They were formed where light and sound met.

!!! danger "Canon Clarification"
    The **Kinsfolk** were not present during **the Fall** or **the Scorching**. They are not descended from **[Highborn](highborn.md)**. They are a distinct creation.

## "Lowborn"

A derogatory term used by **Highborn** and echoed by some **[Keepers](the-keepers.md)** to refer to the **Kinsfolk**. Not a factual limitation — a slur, not a classification.

## Childhood, Care & Pre-Spark Life

Infants are carried in slings by their mothers during earliest years. Once children can walk and speak, they move freely about the settlement. From early childhood until roughly age ten, children are communally watched and cared for. Responsibility for safety and correction is shared among all adults.

### Early Exposure

Around age ten, children begin gravitating informally toward **[Orders](../systems/orders.md)**. They assist with basic tasks and observe crafts in daily life. This period is loosely guided and exploratory.

### Foundational Instruction

From approximately ages ten to sixteen: the **[Order of Word](../systems/orders.md)** teaches all children to read and write. After initial literacy, children attend instruction under the **[Order of Measure](../systems/orders.md)**, focused on counting, calendars, ratios, and basic reckoning.

### Toward the Spark

After basic instruction, children increasingly assist across multiple crafts. Household labor and communal work are emphasized. This period is understood as discovering one's **[Spark](../systems/sparks.md)** rather than proving it.
