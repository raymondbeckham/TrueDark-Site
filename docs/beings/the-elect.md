# The Elect

<span class="entity-badge entity-badge--dark">Being — Dark</span>

**[Highborn](highborn.md)** who followed **[Nova](nova.md)**. They shared in his insurrection during **[Eyru's](eyru.md)** absence. Entrusted with distinct domains of governance and function within **[Lightmere](../places/lightmere.md)**, they acted as **Nova's** lieutenants and commanders rather than mere followers.

Each gave themselves over to the same darkness **Nova** had begun to emit. Their fall was gradual before it was catastrophic.

## What The Elect Became

After **[the Scorching](../events/the-scorching.md)**, **the Elect** were burned to spirit. They became **[the Shades](the-shades.md)**.
