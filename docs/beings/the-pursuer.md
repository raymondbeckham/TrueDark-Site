# The Pursuer

<span class="entity-badge entity-badge--dark">Being — Wandering Name</span>

Collective mythic name for **[the Shades](the-shades.md)**. Used because **the Shades** were not understood as separate entities but perceived as a single presence. They appear alike in form, reinforcing the belief in singularity. Their appearances in quick succession created the illusion of omnipresence.

This led many **[Kinsfolk](kinsfolk.md)** to believe **the Pursuer** could arise wherever darkness lay, without traveling. In truth, this was the result of many **Shades** acting independently or in loose coordination.

**The Pursuer** pressures, narrows paths, and attempts to herd the **Kinsfolk** in poor directions. It hunts rather than attacks directly.
