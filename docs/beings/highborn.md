# The Highborn

<span class="entity-badge entity-badge--light">Being — Original Race</span>

Beings created by **[Eyru](eyru.md)** who naturally emitted **[TrueLight](../systems/truelight.md)**. Created during the Age of **[Lightmere](../places/lightmere.md)**. Original inhabitants — builders of early civilization who emitted **TrueLight** innately. They felt themselves only slightly beneath **Eyru**.

The **Highborn** were destroyed or transformed during **[the Scorching](../events/the-scorching.md)**:

- Those who would not reflect **TrueLight** were burned to spirit — became **[Umbra](umbra.md)** and **[the Shades](the-shades.md)**
- Those who still carried some light were diminished — became **[the Keepers](the-keepers.md)**
