# The Fall

<span class="entity-badge entity-badge--dark">Event — Catastrophe</span>

**[Eyru](../beings/eyru.md)** returned to **[Lightmere](../places/lightmere.md)** and found the once-shining civilization overgrown with darkness. The corruption was not complete, but it was spreading and deepening. **Eyru** unleashed **[the Scorching](the-scorching.md)** in response.

**Lightmere** was catastrophically altered. In the immediate aftermath, **[Deepmere](../places/deepmere.md)** became a barren, scorched hellscape. Cities were reduced to ash and glassed stone. Life persisted only in fragments, shadows, and protected remnants.

!!! danger "Key Distinction"
    **The Fall** refers to the event of **Lightmere's** corruption. **[The Scorching](the-scorching.md)** refers specifically to **Eyru's** response — the cataclysmic release of **[TrueLight](../systems/truelight.md)** that burned the corrupted, transformed the survivors, and scarred the world into **Deepmere**.
