# The Scorching

<span class="entity-badge entity-badge--light">Event — Cataclysm</span>

**The Scorching** was **[Eyru's](../beings/eyru.md)** response to the corruption of **[Lightmere](../places/lightmere.md)**. It was an unleashing of overwhelming **[TrueLight](../systems/truelight.md)** upon the world.

**[Highborn](../beings/highborn.md)** who would not reflect **TrueLight** were burned away to spirit. **[Nova](../beings/nova.md)** became **[Umbra](../beings/umbra.md)**. **[The Elect](../beings/the-elect.md)** became **[the Shades](../beings/the-shades.md)**.

**Highborn** who still carried some light survived but were diminished — they became **[the Keepers](../beings/the-keepers.md)**.
