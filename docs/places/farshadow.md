# Farshadow

<span class="entity-badge entity-badge--place">Place — The Settlement</span>

The permanent settlement founded by the **[Kinsfolk](../beings/kinsfolk.md)** at **[the Crossing](the-crossing.md)** — the intersection of **[Worldlines](../systems/worldlines.md)** and the furthest possible distance from **[Eyru](../beings/eyru.md)** and **[Calmere](calmere.md)**.

Chosen for abundant resources and the ability to sustain life. Considered safer due to the perceived protection of **[Oslog](../beings/oslog.md)**, believed to destroy **[Dark Beastlings](../systems/darklife.md)** that approached in the night.

Darkness does not follow freely into **Farshadow**, but remains present beyond its boundary. Vigilance remains necessary.

The current year is approximately **150 AF** (After Founding).
