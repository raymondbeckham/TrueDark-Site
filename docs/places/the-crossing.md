# The Crossing

<span class="entity-badge entity-badge--place">Place — Intersection of Worldlines</span>

The intersection of **[Worldlines](../systems/worldlines.md)**. The furthest possible distance from **[Eyru](../beings/eyru.md)** and **[Calmere](calmere.md)**. Darkness generally seems to hold back from this point — originally believed to be due to **[Oslog](../beings/oslog.md)**. Despite this, it is highly vulnerable to darkness.

The site where **[Farshadow](farshadow.md)** was founded. Also the location of **[the Night-Sun Event](../events/night-sun-event.md)**, where the **[Archfiend](../beings/the-archfiend.md)** attempted to rise directly through the ground at the intersection point.
