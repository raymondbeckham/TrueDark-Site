# Calmere

<span class="entity-badge entity-badge--place">Place — Sacred Mountain</span>

The mountain upon which **[Eyru](../beings/eyru.md)** rested at creation. Name derives from *mere* (ground, soil). Not a throne by intent, but a seat by function. Changed by the weight of **Eyru's** presence.

Later cultures conflate **Calmere** and **Eyru** in myth and song.
