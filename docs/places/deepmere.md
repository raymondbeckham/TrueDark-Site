# Deepmere

<span class="entity-badge entity-badge--place">Place — The Broken World</span>

The world after **[the Fall](../events/the-fall.md)** and **[the Scorching](../events/the-scorching.md)**. Scarred, wounded, but survivable. **[Umbra](../beings/umbra.md)** resides within it.

The name derives from *mere*, meaning ground or soil. Formerly called **[Lightmere](lightmere.md)**.

Under conditions of **[TrueDark](../systems/truedark.md)**, **[Umbral Essence](../systems/umbral-essence.md)** seeps from **Umbra** through the body of **Deepmere**, reanimating the dead into **[Dark Beastlings](../systems/darklife.md)**.
