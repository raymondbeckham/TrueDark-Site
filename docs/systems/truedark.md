# TrueDark

<span class="entity-badge entity-badge--dark">Concept — Cosmic Force</span>

The absolute absence of light. Enables **[Umbra's](../beings/umbra.md)** influence and the emergence of **[Umbral Essence](umbral-essence.md)**. The conditions under which darkness gains power in **[Deepmere](../places/deepmere.md)**.

Under **TrueDark** conditions, **Umbral Essence** seeps from **Umbra** through the body of **Deepmere**, reanimating the dead into **[Dark Beastlings](darklife.md)**.
