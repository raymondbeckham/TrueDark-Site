# Beastlings

<span class="entity-badge entity-badge--light">Concept — Fauna</span>

The common term for animals. A squirrel is a forest **beastling**; a fish is a water **beastling**. The word carries no negative connotation — it simply means a living creature of the wild.

**Beastlings** are named by their habitat: forest beastlings, mountain beastlings, shore beastlings, and so on.

When dead **beastlings** or their remains are reanimated by **[Umbral Essence](umbral-essence.md)**, they become **[Dark Beastlings](darklife.md)**.
