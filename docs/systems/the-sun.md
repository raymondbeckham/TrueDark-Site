# The Sun

<span class="entity-badge entity-badge--light">Concept — Cosmic Presence</span>

**[TrueLight](truelight.md)** after ascension. Set in the sky by **[Eyru](../beings/eyru.md)** after departure. Circles **[Deepmere](../places/deepmere.md)** continuously.

Serves as offered protection for all who inhabit **Deepmere**. Does not command or compel; its light is given, not enforced.

Culturally believed to search for those who left **Eyru** (the **[Kinsfolk](../beings/kinsfolk.md)**), though this belief is unproven.
