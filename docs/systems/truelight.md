# TrueLight

<span class="entity-badge entity-badge--light">Concept — Cosmic Force</span>

Considered the highest form of light. Includes light from **[Eyru](../beings/eyru.md)**, light of **[the Sun](the-sun.md)**, and light from flame and burning things. Source of creation for the **[Highborn](../beings/highborn.md)** and **[Kinsfolk](../beings/kinsfolk.md)** — an objective, pre-material force.

Cannot be destroyed or created artificially. Burns corruption and corrupted beings away.

## Effects on Dark Beastlings

**TrueLight** burns the skin and husk of **[Dark Beastlings](darklife.md)** on contact (much like sunlight on a vampire), but low levels will not kill them outright. Only intense or sustained **TrueLight** is lethal.

## Cultural & Metaphorical Use

Also used metaphorically to signify the highest form of good. In speech and song, calling something "TrueLight" is an extreme compliment. Example: *"Your voice in that song was TrueLight itself."*
