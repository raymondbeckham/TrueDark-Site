# The Orders

<span class="entity-badge entity-badge--light">Society — Governance</span>

Knowledge was divided into formal **Orders** of competence. Each **Order** governs a domain of understanding and labor. Membership determines training, authority, and social standing.

| Order | Domain |
|-------|--------|
| **Order of Measure** | Mathematics, timekeeping, surveying, records of quantity |
| **Order of Word** | Writing, law, contracts, history, formal speech, Temple administration |
| **Order of Making** | Construction, stonework, metalwork, tools, fabrication |
| **Order of Flame** | Controlled fire, forges, furnaces, energy, light systems |
| **Order of Flesh** | Healing, medicine, anatomy, bodily care |
| **Order of Exchange** | Trade, valuation, logistics, storage, distribution |
| **Order of the Greenwood** | Forestry, timber, land stewardship, managed harvest, resource renewal |
| **Order of Tides** | Fishing, navigation, netting, preservation of catch, waterborne knowledge |

Society emphasized steadfastness and early commitment to minimize wasted resources. This segmentation replaced older, holistic understandings of light and vigilance.

Over time, authority increasingly flowed through the **Orders** rather than communal consensus. What lay outside the **Orders** was often dismissed as unproven, outdated, or symbolic.
