# Worldlines

<span class="entity-badge entity-badge--light">Concept — Cosmic Structure</span>

Invisible lines of force or connection that run through **[Deepmere](../places/deepmere.md)**. Their origin and full nature are not understood.

They intersect at a single point — **[the Crossing](../places/the-crossing.md)** — which is the furthest possible distance from **[Eyru](../beings/eyru.md)** and **[Calmere](../places/calmere.md)**.

The **[Kinsfolk](../beings/kinsfolk.md)** discovered the **Worldlines** during the Wandering and followed them to **the Crossing**. Darkness appears to respect or avoid the intersection point, though the reason is unknown.

The **black cloud** that heralds **[Archfiend](../beings/the-archfiend.md)** risings travels along a **Worldline** toward **the Crossing**.
