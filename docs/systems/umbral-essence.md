# Umbral Essence

<span class="entity-badge entity-badge--dark">Concept — Dark Force</span>

A dark force that emits from **[Umbra](../beings/umbra.md)** himself, seeping outward through the body of **[Deepmere](../places/deepmere.md)** under conditions of **[TrueDark](truedark.md)**. Not a separate entity — an extension of **Umbra's** presence, diffuse and impersonal. It carries his influence but not his will or consciousness.

## Reanimation

**Umbral Essence** reanimates the dead: corpses of **[beastlings](beastlings.md)**, severed limbs, disembodied remains. This reanimation produces **[DarkLife](darklife.md)** — a zombie-like state in which the remains become **Dark Beastlings**, hostile to all things of the light.

**DarkLife** does not think, remember, or act with purpose beyond destruction. It is drawn to **[Kinsfolk](../beings/kinsfolk.md)** and to sources of light.

## Destruction of DarkLife

The reanimated body or body part can be destroyed by physical force sufficient to render it unable to act, or by fire — burned to cinder and ash. **[TrueLight](truelight.md)** burns **DarkLife** on contact, scorching skin and husk, but low levels of **TrueLight** will not kill outright. Only intense or sustained **TrueLight** is lethal to **Dark Beastlings**.
