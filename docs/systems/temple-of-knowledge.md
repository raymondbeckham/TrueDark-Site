# The Temple of Knowledge

<span class="entity-badge entity-badge--light">Society — Institution</span>

## Governance

The **Temple of Knowledge** is governed jointly by the **[Order of Word](orders.md)** and the **[Order of Measure](orders.md)**. Their functions are deeply intertwined: **Word** governs record, law, doctrine, and instruction; **Measure** governs time, accounting, verification, and validation.

Other **[Orders](orders.md)** operate under Temple coordination rather than independent authority.

## Current Temple Doctrine

The Temple now teaches that the dangers of the past were misinterpreted phenomena. Earlier accounts of darkness are framed as fear-driven misunderstandings and symbolic language applied to natural events. **[Dark Beastlings](darklife.md)** are acknowledged as real but mundane threats — not signs of greater forces.

### Reinterpretation of Darkness

**[The Pursuer](../beings/the-pursuer.md)** is taught to have been shadows, coincidence, and collective fear during hardship. **[The Archfiend](../beings/the-archfiend.md)** is taught as a superstition born of ignorance. **[Umbra](../beings/umbra.md)** is acknowledged only as a historical belief, now declared false.

### Modern Teaching on TrueDark

**[TrueDark](truedark.md)** and **[Umbral Essence](umbral-essence.md)** are acknowledged as real but rare phenomena. Their effects are presented as exaggerated in early records and environmental rather than intentional. No will, intelligence, or singular malice is taught.

### Attitude Toward the Past

Past generations are viewed as earnest but uninformed, limited by fear and lack of knowledge. The Temple presents itself as having outgrown superstition. Confidence is framed as progress.

### Institutional Tone

Teaching is self-assured and dismissive. Warnings are reframed as cautionary metaphor. Vigilance is treated as unnecessary strain.
