# Record, Memory & Truth

<span class="entity-badge entity-badge--light">Society — Knowledge</span>

## Year Counting

Formal year-counting begins with the founding of **[Farshadow](../places/farshadow.md)**. Years are recorded as **After Founding (AF)**. Events prior to this are referenced relative to the Wandering or **[Keeper](../beings/the-keepers.md)** encounters.

## The Nature of the Record

**Farshadow's** history is recorded as faithfully as possible, though never omnisciently. Early accounts are considered honest, even when incomplete or misinterpreted.

As generations pass, lived experience is increasingly reframed as metaphor. This reframing does not negate reality, but alters interpretation.

Knowledge preserved by the **[Temple](temple-of-knowledge.md)** is understood to be true in origin, partial in scope, and shaped by perspective and survival. Corruption of meaning does not imply fabrication — only distance from firsthand understanding.
