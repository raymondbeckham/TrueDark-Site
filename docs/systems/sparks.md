# Sparks & Commitment

<span class="entity-badge entity-badge--light">Society — Social System</span>

## Age of Choosing

Individuals are required to choose their first **[Order](orders.md)** at sixteen years of age. This is considered the point of full adulthood. The choice is mandatory, not advisory. Delay or refusal is not permitted.

The choosing occurs only on the final day of each season. New adults choose four times per year, not individually by birthdate. A person makes their choice on the final day of the season in which they were born.

!!! note "Timekeeping Context"
    **[Farshadow](../places/farshadow.md)** uses a 364-day year divided into four seasons of 91 days. Each season consists of two 30-day months followed by a 31-day month. The final day of each season is set aside to recognize **[Eyru](../beings/eyru.md)**. On these days, attempts to produce a display of **[TrueLight](truelight.md)** may be made (extremely rare).

## Brands & Social Recognition

**Order** affiliation is marked through brands on the palms. These brands are deliberately placed where they are visible during greeting and agreement.

Customary greeting involves presenting open hands slightly away from the body, clasping right hands, drawing into a brief half-embrace, and the left hand patting the other's back. This practice allows the other party to see the left palm and feel the right, revealing **Order** history.

## First Spark

When an individual enters their first **Order**. The **Order** chosen is believed to align with their underlying **Spark**. Marked by the **Order** brand on the left palm. Signifies trust, investment, and assumed alignment between person and work.

## Second Spark

When an individual leaves or is removed from a first **Order** and enters a second. Interpreted as evidence that the first **Spark** was misjudged or weak. Marked by the brand of the second **Order** on the right palm. Can be detected both visually and by touch during greeting. Carries social suspicion and reduced perceived value.

Each time an individual leaves or is expelled from an **Order**, the previous brand is marred — a simple burned strikethrough is placed over the old mark, visibly recording failure or rejection.

Individuals who leave or are expelled from a second **Order** are declared **[Sparkless](../beings/the-sparkless.md)**.
