# DarkLife & Dark Beastlings

<span class="entity-badge entity-badge--dark">Concept — Reanimated Threats</span>

## DarkLife

**DarkLife** is the zombie-like state produced when **[Umbral Essence](umbral-essence.md)** reanimates dead **[beastlings](beastlings.md)** (animals), severed limbs, or disembodied remains. The reanimated remains are bent entirely toward the destruction of things of the light, particularly **[Kinsfolk](../beings/kinsfolk.md)**.

**DarkLife** does not think, remember, or act with purpose beyond destruction.

## Dark Beastlings

The reanimated dead produced by **Umbral Essence**. Named by combining "Dark" with the creature's habitat type:

| Original Creature | Dark Beastling Name |
|---|---|
| Forest squirrel | **Dark Forest Beastling** |
| Shore crab | **Dark Shore Beastling** |
| Mountain goat | **Dark Mountain Beastling** |

Distinguished from **Umbral Essence** itself (which is diffuse and impersonal) and from **[the Shades](../beings/the-shades.md)** (who retain individual will and memory).

## How to Destroy Dark Beastlings

| Method | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Physical destruction** | Damage sufficient to render the body unable to act — dismemberment, crushing |
| **Fire** | Burned to cinder and ash — fully lethal |
| **Low TrueLight** | Burns skin and husk on contact (like sunlight on a vampire) but will not kill |
| **Intense TrueLight** | Sustained or intense exposure is lethal |

A persistent threat at the edges of **[Farshadow](../places/farshadow.md)**.
